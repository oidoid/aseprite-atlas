Explore dropping CPU animation or document why CPU animation is needed (within animation collision changes, end of animation cycle events, ...).
Add API documentation for at least the primary exports: `Aseprite`, `AtlasMetaParser`, `Animator`, `AtlasMeta`, and `Film`. The `Animator` documentation should probably include a usage example in a game loop-like scenario.
Can a JSON format be supported? This would allow the parse step to happen at compilation instead of run time.
  How should infinite be represented? Some kind of null or string hack that must use a special deserializer? Switch to JSON alternative?
Add a more thorough demo. For example, a very small game showcasing a few things: different collisioning (including Aseprite GUI screenshots of slices), tiling, different animations, parsing and image loading, a mini sprite / entity system.
