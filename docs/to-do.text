Add API documentation for at least the primary exports: `Aseprite`, `AtlasMetaParser`, `Animator`, `AtlasMeta`, and `Film`.
Add FilmID argument support to atlas-pack executable.
Add a more thorough demo. For example, a very small game showcasing a few things: different collisioning (including Aseprite GUI screenshots of slices), tiling, different animations, parsing and image loading, a mini sprite / entity system.
